# Banking-System

We live busy lives these days. Between work, chores, and other things on our to-do lists, it can be tough to catch your breath and stay calm.

Credit cards are one of the things that save us time, energy, and nerves. From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with a database.

Based on Luhn algorithm and SQLlite package of python, we make a banking system that avoid mistakes when entering the card number.
